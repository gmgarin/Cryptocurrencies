## Overview of the Analysis:

### This project aims to create a report for Accounting Accountabilty, an investment company. This report includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. Since there is no known output, *unsupervised machine learning* was used to process and cluster data,and, to reduce dimensions and principal components using principal component analysis (PCA)
